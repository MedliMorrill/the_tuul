      <strong>Step 1: Choose a music file.</strong> Click the
      <code>Choose a song file</code> button and pick your song. Easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2: Prepare the lyrics.</strong> Paste song lyrics into the
      <code>Lyrics</code> box. Next, divide them up into screens by adding a
      blank line between the last line of one screen and the first line of the
      next. <strong>Pro tip:</strong> listen to the song once while reading the
      lyrics, to make sure all the lyrics are there. Sometimes the Internet is
      wrong.

      <strong>Step 3: Add Timing Information.</strong> You're gonna tell The
      Tüül when all those lyrics appear in the song. When you hit the Play
      button, the song will start playing, and the first lyric-bit that you
      chopped up will be highlighted in pink.
      <strong>Hit the spacebar</strong> when that lyric comes up, and then the
      next lyric will turn pink and await your spacebar-press.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you hit the <strong>Enter</strong> key while the song is playing, that
      will mark the end of the <strong>previous</strong> lyric. Do that when
      there's a gap between lines or words. It can be tricky to handle both the
      spacebar and the enter key. If the song is going too fast, slow it down by
      clicking a different playback speed.
    </p>
    <p>If you need to take a break, hit the Pause button.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4: Create The Video.</strong> After you've given a spacebar
      press to the last lyric in the song, click the <code>Submit</code> button.
      Wait a few minutes -- maybe 3? Maybe 6? Eventually you'll be asked to
      download a zip file. In that file are 2 mp4 files.
      <code>karaoke.mp4</code> uses your spacebar presses exactly as you entered
      them. <code>karaoke-corrected.mp4</code> tries to use some magic to make
      your spacebar presses a little more accurate. Use whichever one works
      better! The zip file also includes generated
      <code>subtitles.ass</code> and <code>timings.json</code> files that were
      used to make your video. You can ignore them.
