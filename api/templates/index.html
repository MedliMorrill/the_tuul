            <h1>The T端端l - Make Your Own Karaoke Video</h1>
            <p><strong>Step 1: Choose a music file.</strong> Click the <code>Choose a song file</code> button and pick
                your song. Easy.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2: Prepare the lyrics.</strong> Paste song lyrics into the <code>Lyrics</code> box. Next,
                divide them up into screens by adding a blank line between the last line of one screen and the first
                line of the next. <strong>Pro tip:</strong> listen to the song once while reading the lyrics, to make
                sure all the lyrics are there.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3: Add Timing Information.</strong> You're gonna tell The T端端l when all those lyrics appear
                in the song. When you hit the Play button, the song will start playing, and the first lyric-bit that you
                chopped up will be highlighted in pink. <strong>Hit the spacebar</strong> when that lyric comes up, and
                then the next lyric will turn pink and await your spacebar-press.</p>
            <p>If you hit the <strong>Enter</strong> key while the song is playing, that will mark the end of the
                <strong>previous</strong> lyric. Do that when there are pauses in the music. It can be tricky to handle
                both the spacebar and the enter key. If the song is going too fast, slow it down by clicking a different
                playback speed at the bottom.</p>
            <p>If you need to take a break, hit the Pause button.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 4: Create The Video.</strong> After you've given a spacebar press to the last lyric in the
                song, click the <code>Submit</code> button. Wait a few minutes -- maybe 3? Maybe 6? Eventually you'll be
                asked to download a zip file. In that file are 2 mp4 files. <code>karaoke.mp4</code> uses your spacebar
                presses exactly as you entered them. <code>karaoke-corrected.mp4</code> tries to use some magic to make
                your spacebar presses a little more accurate. Use whichever one works better!</p>
